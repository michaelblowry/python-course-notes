<h2>Why Python?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-python" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Civil engineers can do most of their work with a calculator, Excel, and specialized software, but sometimes analysis and design requires custom computer programming. Right now, and for the near future, experts agree that Python is the best programming language to learn for a wide variety of analysis and design tasks.</p>
<p>Python is…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>one of the easiest computer languages to learn,</p></li>
<li><p>similar to other languages and can be a stepping stone to others if desired,</p></li>
<li><p>very fast and powerful for data analysis and solving engineering problems,</p></li>
<li><p>easy to share and collaborate with team members,</p></li>
<li><p>used by most big tech companies, including Google, Facebook, and Netflix,</p></li>
<li><p>easily integrated with other software, including Excel, ArcGIS, and VISSIM, and</p></li>
<li><p>has thousands of extra “packages” that people are continually improving and providing for free on the internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do a Google search for best computer languages, you will find Python is often ranked number one or
least in the top five. If you focus your search on computer languages for science, math, engineering, and data analysis,
then Python is king. Various organizations publish annual rankings of computer languages.

<h2>What is Python?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-python" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are lots of computer languages. New languages are being created by smart computer scientists every year. The first “modern” language was simply called “<em>C</em>”. The reason is because in 1972 the guys at Bell Labs who invented it had previously created a language that they called “<em>A</em>” and then they created something better that they called
“<em>B</em>”.
When they got to “<em>C</em>” it was so good they stopped trying to improve it. <em>C</em> became the main programming
language for many years and continues to be a leading language.</p>
<p>Improvements were eventually made to <em>C</em> and became distinct languages such as <em>C++</em> and <em>C#</em>. Other languages are Fortran, Java, PHP, R, GO, and Pearl.
Computer languages differ in syntax and vocabulary, just like spoken languages. For example in English adjectives go
before the noun, while in Spanish the adjective comes after the noun. Computer scientists create new languages to
make them faster, more efficient, or easier to use. One way to categorize computer languages is by programming method
. Some languages are better than others for a particular programming method. For example <em>SQL</em> is really good
for Declarative programming. <em>C#</em> is really good for Object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>A computer scientist named Guido van Rossum wanted to create a computer language that could efficiently be used with <em>all</em>
these programming methods. More importantly he wanted the language to be easy to read and write. In 1991 he released
Python, which he named after <em>Monty Python</em> the comedy TV show and movie series.</p>

<h2>How do I install Python?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-install-python" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are many versions of Python, many ways to install it, and many many add-in extra “modules” or “packages” (also called libraries in other computer languages) that can be additionally installed.</p>
<p>Save yourself a huge headache and simply install the “Anaconda Distribution” with the lastest version of Python.
The Anaconda installation will include all the best packages, a great code editor called Spyder, and other tools for easily adding and updating packages.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">https://www.anaconda.com/download</a></p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/"><img alt="_images/anaconda-download.png" src="_images/anaconda-download.png" /></a>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There were significant changes from Python version 2.7 to Python 3. Consequently, the Anaconda people still make Python 2.7 available for legacy applications that some people might be using still. You should install
the newest version, which is currently Python 3.7.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-get-started">
<h2>How do I get started?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-get-started" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>There are many ways to interact with Python once it has been installed. The best way is to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Spyder, IDLE, or PyCharm. The Anaconda Distribution includes Spyder.</p>
<p>I recommend you pin Spyder to your taskbar for easy access. Naviagate to the Anaconda folder, right click on the Spyder program, click More, and click Pin to taskbar.</p>
<img alt="_images/spyder-pin-to-taskbar.png" src="_images/spyder-pin-to-taskbar.png" />
<p>When you first open Spyder it should look something like the image shown below. The layout in Spyder is completely customizable, which means you can close, open, and rearrange the windows how you please. I recommend the default layout with the three windows (calle panes) shown below.</p>
<img alt="_images/spyder-open.jpg" src="_images/spyder-open.jpg" />
<p>The first window pane is the Editor where you will write code that can be saved and used later.
The second window pane is the Console where you can also write code, but it is not saved. Code written in the Editor and code written in the Console is output to the Console. The Console is also called the Interpreter.
The third window pane is where you can read help files and explore the data that you are using.</p>
<p>I recommend that today and throughout your learning that you explore the Spyder GUI (graphical user interface), i.e. close and move windows, push different buttons and menus, etc. Don’t worry, you won’t break it. And you can always put everything back to normal by going to Tools/Reset Spyder to factory defaults. For example, some people like to have certain panes on or off, which can be done at View/Panes.</p>

<div class="section" id="write-your-first-computer-program">
<h2>Write your first computer program<a class="headerlink" href="#write-your-first-computer-program" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Begin by typing in the Console <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">5</span></code>. Hit enter.
Now write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">6</span></code> and hit enter again.</p>
<p>The variables <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span></code> are now stored in your computer. You can see this by looking at the Variable explorer in
the upper right pane. Now write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">b</span></code> and hit enter to see how Python can be used as calculator.</p>
<img alt="_images/variable-explorer.png" src="_images/variable-explorer.png" />
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The Spyder console uses a format called IPython that looks like this:</p>
<img alt="_images/ipython-prompt.png" src="_images/ipython-prompt.png" />
<p>The IPython input prompt is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">In</span> <span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code> and numbered consecutively. Likewise, output is preceded with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Out</span> <span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code>
and the corresponding number.</p>
<p>The original Python prompt, which can be seen if you use IDLE to write code, uses three arrows <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code> for input
and shows nothing before output.
Like this:</p>
<img alt="_images/idle-prompt.png" src="_images/idle-prompt.png" />
</div>
<p>“The” official Python Tutorial begins its introduction by showing how the Console (also called the Interpreter) can be used as a calculator.
See <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/introduction.html">An Informal Introduction to Python</a></p>
<p>Indeed the Console can be useful for quick calculations or to check output. But for long procedures (i.e. multiple calculations in a sequence)
it is better to use the Editor. The Editor allows you to save the code as a “script” and re-run the script later. Furthermore,
if you only use the Console, then once you close Spyder all the variables will be lost.</p>
<p>Now write your first program in the Editor. Write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">500</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">600</span></code> as shown below. This is a program and doesn’t do anything until we <em>Run</em> the
program. Also, write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(a</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">b)</span></code>. And, for fun, also write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(&quot;Hello</span> <span class="pre">World&quot;)</span></code> (There is a tradition in
computer programming that your first program should say “Hello World”.) To run your program, hit the
green play button. You will first need to save your script. For my course <em>CE 215</em>, you will put scripts in your U: drive folder
CE215/Python. Name the file with your last name, the word Practice, and the lab number (all separated by underscores).
The script will automatically be given a .py extension. So this first program file will be: <em>Lastname_Practice_1.1.py</em></p>
<img alt="_images/hello-world-note.png" src="_images/hello-world-note.png" />
<p>The output from running your script will be shown in the Console. You can check the values of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span></code> in the
Variable Editor.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This is called a “script” or a “program” just like when you go to the theater and the actors
follow the sequential lines of their script and the play follows the program. Python reads each line of the program from from top to bottom
. When using the console we could simply write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">b</span></code> to print the result. However, when using a script we need to
explicitly say when to do something. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print()</span></code> is how we tell the script to print something to the console.</p>
