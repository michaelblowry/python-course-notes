Python for Civil Engineers
==========================

*Python for Civil Engineers* is an interactive website to learn Python. Anyone interested in learning Python \
can copy and paste the code provided on this website. Civil Engineers increasingly need to use computer code to analyze large datasets or to write short *scripts* \
that will interact with software. At minimum, Civil Engineers need to understand the logic of algorthims for \
computer-aided analysis and design. This website introduces fundamental concepts in computer programming, \
including the ``if`` statement and ``for`` loop. Click Next at the bottom of each page to proceed.

This interactive website was created for *CE 215 Civil Engineering Analysis and Design*, a required course at the University of \
Idaho. Click here for the `course syllabus. <https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~mlowry/Teaching/syllabus.ce215.pdf>`_
